The ‘Dear Green Place’ is the perfect place to host a sustainable and inclusive COP. It has set a target for carbon neutrality by 2030, aims to be one of the greenest cities in Europe through its Sustainable Glasgow campaign, and is 4th in the world in the Global Destination Sustainability Index.

lt also has a proven track record of hosting events on the international stage, such as the 2014 Commonwealth Games and the 2018 Glasgow European Gymnastic Championships.

Surrounded by the river, the city and its parks, the location will inspire attendees to tackle climate change and protect the planet for future generations.

Protecting the health of both the participants at COP26 and the local community of Glasgow is foremost in our minds as we plan the event and we continue to explore all available options to achieve this.
