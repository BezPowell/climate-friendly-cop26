The UK and Italy are committed to putting climate change and the reversal of biodiversity loss at the heart of the multilateral agenda in 2021, including through the G7, G20 and COP26 Presidencies. 

As part of this UK-Italy Presidency Partnership year, we agree on the need to build back better following the impact of COVID-19. 

We will work with our international partners, and through our Presidencies, in support of a green and resilient recovery that promotes sustainable growth and jobs and delivers for those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. 

We are calling on all countries to submit ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions and set out long term strategies to net zero emissions well in advance of COP26. 

We will leverage our G7 and G20 Presidencies to drive forward the COP26 campaigns and help build momentum towards a successful COP26 outcome.

### This will include working with our international partners to advance action for our four COP26 goals:
- a step change in commitments to emissions reduction
- strengthening adaptation to climate change impacts
- getting finance flowing for climate action
- enhancing international collaboration, including for the COP26 campaigns on energy transition, clean road transport and nature
