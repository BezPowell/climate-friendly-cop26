+++
We have shown that climate action can go hand-in-hand with economic growth. 

Between 1990 and 2019, we achieved record clean growth. In that time, our economy grew by 78% and our emissions decreased by 44% over this time, the fastest decline in the G7.

### UK Domestic Leadership
1. We have decarbonised our economy faster than any other country in the G20 since 2000.
2. We were the first major economy to put into law that we will reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050.
3. We are the largest producer of offshore wind energy in the world.
4. We will end direct government support for the fossil fuel energy sector overseas.
5. We are doubling our international climate finance to help developing nations with £11.6bn a year by 2025.
6. We have announced the end of the sale of new petrol and diesel cars in the UK by 2030, putting the UK on course to be the fastest G7 country to decarbonise cars and vans.
7. We will spend at least £3bn of our international climate finance in the next 5 years on nature and nature based solutions.
8. We are planting trees on 30,000 hectares of land per year by 2025.
9. We have announced plans that put farmers at the forefront of reversing environmental decline and tackling climate change.
10. We will make climate-related disclosures mandatory across the economy by 2025, with most requirements coming in by 2023.
11. The low carbon sector and supply chain provides over 460,000 jobs in the UK. Our ambition is for up to 2 million green jobs by 2030.

### The UK’s Nationally Determined Contribution

On 12 December 2020, the UK communicated its new [Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uks-nationally-determined-contribution-communication-to-the-unfccc) under the Paris Agreement to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The NDC commits the UK to reducing economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions by at least 68% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. It also includes information on how this target was developed and is quantified, known as ‘information to facilitate clarity, transparency, and understanding’ (ICTU).

### Carbon Budget 6 

On 20 April 2021, the UK Government [announced](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-enshrines-new-target-in-law-to-slash-emissions-by-78-by-2035) that it will build on its NDC commitments to 2030, by setting the world’s most ambitious climate change target into law to reduce emissions by 78% by 2035 compared to 1990 levels.

In line with the recommendation from the independent Climate Change Committee, this sixth Carbon Budget limits the volume of greenhouse gases emitted over a 5-year period from 2033 to 2037, taking the UK more than three-quarters of the way to reaching net zero by 2050. 

### The UK’s Adaptation Communication

We also submitted our first [Adaptation Communication](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uks-adaptation-communication-to-the-united-nations-framework-convention-on-climate-change-unfccc-2020) to the UNFCCC on 12 December 2020. This report sets out what the UK is doing to prepare for the effects of climate change at home and to support those facing impacts overseas.

### The UK’s Biennial Finance Communication

Our first [Biennial Finance Communication](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-biennial-finance-communication-to-the-un-framework-convention-on-climate-change-2020) was submitted to the UNFCCC. This report demonstrates our forward looking action on the support components of the Paris Agreement.

Taken together, these parallel documents detail the UK’s action across the mitigation, adaptation, and finance pillars of the Paris Agreement.

Leading the world in tackling and adapting to climate change is a major economic opportunity for the UK, that will create new skilled jobs across the country. But there is still much to be done, and COP26 will be a central part of making sure we succeed.
