+++
The UK aims to bring countries together to agree a comprehensive, ambitious and balanced outcome that takes forward coordinated climate action and resolves key issues related to the UNFCCC, the [Kyoto Protocol](https://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol) and the [Paris Agreement](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement)*.

Paris set the destination – limiting warming well below 2 degrees, aiming for 1.5 degrees –  Glasgow must make it a reality.

### Aims of the Negotiations

**We want the outcome to accelerate action to:**
- Reduce emissions
- Strengthen adaptation and resilience to climate impacts
- Scale up finance and support

**In doing so it should:**
- Protect and restore nature
- Follow [the best available science](https://unfccc.int/topics/science/the-big-picture/science-in-the-negotiations)
- Empower inclusive action 

### Negotiation issues

At COP26 delegates will be aiming to finalise the ‘Paris Rulebook’, the rules needed to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement, and conclude outstanding issues from COP25 in Madrid. They will also seek to deliver on all essential negotiating items for 2020 and 2021.

**From our extensive engagement with countries, the most commonly raised priorities include:**
- Enabling ambition through [carbon markets](https://unfccc.int/topics/what-are-market-and-non-market-mechanisms)
- Rules for the [transparent reporting](https://unfccc.int/enhanced-transparency-framework) of action and support 
- Common timeframes for emission reduction commitments 
- Enabling enhanced [adaptation action](https://unfccc.int/topics/adaptation-and-resilience/the-big-picture/what-do-adaptation-to-climate-change-and-climate-resilience-mean) 
- Averting, minimising and addressing [loss and damage](https://unfccc.int/topics/adaptation-and-resilience/the-big-picture/introduction-to-loss-and-damage) 
- Means of implementation, including the initiation of deliberations on a new goal for [global climate finance](https://unfccc.int/topics/climate-finance/the-big-picture/introduction-to-climate-finance) after 2025 
- Responding to the latest science and the ambition of current emission reduction targets 
- Promoting fair, inclusive climate action

There are many other issues for discussion at COP26, including several important sector specific topics not listed above.

### Our approach

Although COVID-19 has posed challenges for the multilateral climate change process, we are committed to making progress in a **transparent** and **inclusive** way and in **solidarity** with all countries. 

We have set out how we will do this on the [Road to Glasgow](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/conferences/road-to-glasgow), including detailed plans in collaboration with Chile (the current COP President) and Italy (our [Partner for COP26](https://ukcop26.org/pre-cop/) and the host of [pre-COP](https://ukcop26.org/pre-cop/pre-cop-milan/)), as well as the UNFCCC Secretariat and the Chairs of the two UNFCCC Subsidiary Bodies. 

COP President Designate Alok Sharma wrote an [open letter](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/COP26%20%20President%20Designate%20Open%20letter.pdf) to Parties setting out what the Presidency has heard from Parties and groups on their expectations for Glasgow and the importance of making progress.

### UK engagement

**In 2020 the UK secured the agreement from the COP Bureau to postpone and reschedule COP26 to 2021, but the work has continued. We have and continue to:**
- engage widely with ministers and officials to deepen shared understanding on all relevant issues,
- encourage practical action and commitments on mitigation, adaptation and support, including finance,
- support UN climate processes, including last year’s June Momentum on Climate Change and the UN Climate Change Dialogues, and the May-June 2021 Climate Change Conference.

In the run up to COP26 we are strengthening ministerial engagement with countries, negotiating groups and non-state actors. 

In collaboration with Chile, we have also begun a new series of [monthly multilateral consultations](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/bodies/supreme-bodies/conference-of-the-parties-cop/presidency-consultations-and-other-presidency-meetings/informal-consultations-by-the-cop-25-presidency-and-the-cop-26-incoming-presidency) with Heads of Delegations to address specific negotiations issues. These will complement the busy schedule of technical and high-level meetings taking place this year, building the conditions for success at Glasgow.

**To enable transparency and inclusivity, you can [see summaries online](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/bodies/supreme-bodies/conference-of-the-parties-cop/presidency-consultations-and-other-presidency-meetings/informal-consultations-by-the-cop-25-presidency-and-the-cop-26-incoming-presidency) of many of the discussions so far on these critical issues.**

We count on the commitment of all countries and partners to achieve a positive outcome at COP26 and beyond.
